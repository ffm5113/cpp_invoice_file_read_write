# cpp_invoice_file_reader
The Invoice File Reader Program (C++) reads invoice details from a .txt file, printing a detailed list of the invoices and their calculated total costs. An output file named output.txt is created to mirror the console output.

Exception handling: if there is an error reading the file, the program prints and error message and exits.
